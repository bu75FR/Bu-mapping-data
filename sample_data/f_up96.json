For the first time in his 24 years as a wine maker, Stephan saw these grapes fermenting in the same tank. The result is a seamless, complex work of art. Fresh aromas of plums, macerated blackberries, and blueberries in the nose, and dark, intense fruit on the palate. The mouth and lengthy finish are made more complex by hints of leather, tar, and tobacco leaf. An augmentation of Petit Verdot puts the 2004 on the classic track of the 2001 vintage.",
